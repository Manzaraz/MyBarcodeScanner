# Welcome to MyBarcodeScanner


Hello! I'm Chris, a frontend developer dreaming of jumping to the dark side of mobile development using Swift. This time, I want to share with you my latest project: "My Barcode Scanner." This application allows me to retrieve the number from a barcode. While its functionality isn't very complex, it marks my first encounter with CoreML (Machine Learning on Apple), and I must say I'm pleasantly surprised by how easy it is to use.
Thank you for visiting this repository! If you like what you see, I would appreciate a "Star" to know that the project is being valued. Feel free to share it on your social media.
